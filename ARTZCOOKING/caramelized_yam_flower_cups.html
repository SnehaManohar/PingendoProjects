                        <p>Well..i have been loving yam right from my childhood where my mom makes
                            crispy yam that has been boiled and shallow fried with very basic spices..i
                            would eagerly wait near my mom and love to eat the fried yam as soon as
                            it was removed from the tawa/pan..i have tasted some other dishes using
                            yam but never have tried anything modern with it..So there was lots of
                            yam lying idle in my fridge and as usual i wanted to try something different
                            and that could be enjoyed by my kids as a evening snack..i love caramel
                            so thought why not try caramelizing the yam..(weird right.. i know i know..i
                            love weird stuffs and mostly i succeed with weird dishes..LOL)..
                            <br>
                            <br>So i tried to combine flavours that could merge with caramelized yam and
                            derived this new recipe and to my surprise each and everything that went
                            into this dish blended so well.i have used readymade spring roll sheets
                            here but you can use homemade sheets too..i will be adding a separate blogpost
                            on how to make the spring roll sheets at home and will update here...
                            <br>
                            <br>this recipe is served best when hot and before the cups loses their crispiness..
                            <br>
                            <br>this recipe is super easy to make with very minimal ingredients...and
                            can be served when you need something to be aesthetic at your party tables..i
                            got my child to do the layers..and she was so happy to be helping me in
                            this..so it is that easy ...I love anything that is caramelized and i wanted
                            something to be different than the regular veggies used..i came up with
                            this recipe and used caramelized yam clubbed with cheese..the final Flower
                            cups filled with the caramelized yam tasted divine with the outer super
                            crispy layer..please do try this recipe and lemme know your feedback&nbsp;

                            apply melted butter with a pastry brush.next place another square on top
                            of the buttered square so that the edge of the top square is slightly adjacent
                            to the edge of the bottom square.now butter the top layer and place one
                            more square strip on top in the same way.(pics attached below for easy
                            understanding).keep adding layers until you are satisfied and all the edges
                            are almost done placing next to each other.(if using homemade sheets..slightly
                            dust the working floor before assembling)</p>

                            them roughly tears the sheets.&nbsp;
                            <br>

                            oven and cool on wire rack.when removed they tend to be crispy and will
                            hold their shapes like flowers.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>11. Grate the cheese cubes finely.Add a teaspoon of the cheese to the

                            it with another teaspoon of grated cheese.repeat the process for all the

                            <br>12. Now bake the flower cups again for 3-5mins at 200°C.the edges should
                            darken .remove and cool in wire rack. 13. Serve hot with ketchup or ranch.

                            <br>
                            <br>&nbsp;1.always serve the cups warm before the cups loses their crispiness.
                            <br>
                            <br>&nbsp;2.when serving to very small kids slightly trim the tips of the
                            cups so that they dont prick their soft tissues when they take a bite.
                            <br>
                            <br>&nbsp;3.if you dont have brown sugar you can substitute regular white
                            sugar but i brown sugar adds more flavour to it.</p>
